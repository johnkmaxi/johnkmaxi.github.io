Using these models, you will be able to make predictions for the future values of things like hotel bookings, product sales, and any other times series, using only historical data of that value. Let's get started!\n",

This visualization will aid you in determing if you should use an additive or a multiplicative model, and if you have selected the right number of periods to capture the seasonality appropriately. "
